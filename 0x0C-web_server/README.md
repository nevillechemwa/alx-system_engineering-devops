A web server is a computer program that delivers web pages to users. It is a software application that runs on a web server computer. Web servers are responsible for storing, processing, and delivering web pages to users. They also handle requests for web resources, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

Web servers are typically accessed by web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. When a user enters a web address into their web browser, the web browser sends a request to the web server. The web server then delivers the requested web page to the user's web browser.

There are many different web servers available, including Apache, Microsoft IIS, Nginx, and LiteSpeed. Apache is the most popular web server, and is used by many websites. Microsoft IIS is a Windows-based web server, while Nginx and LiteSpeed are open-source web servers.

Web servers are an essential part of the World Wide Web. They allow users to access websites and web resources from anywhere in the world.

Here are some of the most important features of a web server:

HTTP: Web servers use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with web browsers. HTTP is a set of rules that govern how web pages are transferred between web servers and web browsers.
File serving: Web servers store web pages and other web resources on disk. When a user requests a web page, the web server delivers the requested web page to the user's web browser.
Request handling: Web servers handle requests for web resources. When a user requests a web page, the web server parses the request and determines which web page to deliver.
Security: Web servers must be secure in order to protect user data. Web servers use a variety of security measures to protect user data, such as firewalls, encryption, and authentication.
